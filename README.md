# McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the nutritional content of menu items available at McDonald's outlets. The analysis provides insights into the calorie count and nutritional facts of various menu items, helping customers make informed food choices and providing valuable information to the organization for menu optimization.

## Objectives
- Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
- Create visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
- Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Nutrical Dataset.csv](link_to_dataset). It contains information about various menu items including serving size, calorie count, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, and daily value percentages for vitamins and minerals.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded and inspected the dataset, handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the distribution of calorie counts and explored the nutritional content of different items.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualize calorie distribution and nutritional content.
5. **Nutrition-Based Insights**: Identified menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts, and determined the average nutritional content of popular menu categories.
6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Summarized findings and insights from the analysis, and explained how the nutritional analysis could benefit McDonald's customers and the organization.

## Insights
- The distribution of calorie counts across menu items varies widely.
- Certain menu categories have higher average nutritional content compared to others.
- Visualizations effectively convey calorie counts and nutritional information.
- Insights highlight healthy and less healthy food options.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations could be made to McDonald's:
1. Introduce more low-calorie and nutritious options to cater to health-conscious customers.
2. Consider reformulating recipes to reduce unhealthy components such as saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars.
3. Increase the availability of fresh and healthy ingredients in menu items.eg:Salads
